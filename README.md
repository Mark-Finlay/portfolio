## Cybersecurity Analyst

### Cybersecurity Certifications:
CompTIA PenTest+ | Cloud+ | Security+ | Network+ | A+

### Summary:

As a helicopter Licensed Aircraft Maintenance Engineer (LAME), I am now transitioning into the cybersecurity
realm. I am actively seeking challenging opportunities in cybersecurity where I can leverage my diverse skillset
and contribute to organisational security and adapt to the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape.
Notable transferrable skills from helicopter maintenance include: time, team & task management, high attention to detail whilst following strict procedures & compliance requirements, precise documentation / record keeping skills and systematic problem solving.

I currently hold CompTIA Pentest+, Cloud+, Security+, Network+ & A+ certifications, and I'm actively working
toward the C|EH (Master) certification. These certifications demonstrate my commitment to this industry and a
relentless drive to improve. With these certifications, I've deepened my expertise in advanced security practices. Ready to tackle evolving threats, I bring a strong foundation to the cybersecurity sector and am eager to contribute to a robust digital defence.

Whilst completing my Bachelors degree in Aviation Management I took advantage of several free choice elective
subjects and achieved high grades in Programming Principles and Data Analytics Methods, both of which were
Python-based.
